                    Microservices
                </h2>
                <p class="">
Microservice computing is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, 
independent, and loosely coupled services, each focusing on a specific business capability.
 These services communicate with each other via well-defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 
This approach offers benefits like independent deployment, enhanced scalability, greater fault tolerance,
 technology flexibility, and faster development cycles, contrasting with traditional monolithic architectures
 where the entire application is built as a single, large unit.

                 Which provides services as user demands. Public clouds are the example of cloud computing platfroms. Because public clouds provides on demand delivery of resources especially data storage and computing powers.
<strong>Edge server</strong> or content delivery network is the strategy which encourage owner to get their web or app space nereast to its audeince so the computing power will be more efficeint.

                   Containers

Container is a runtime instance of image <br>

image is a brief case which contain the code of that application , runtime , libraries, environment variables and configuration files.
using an image we make a container and this process is called <strong>containerization</strong>.
containerization is increasingly popular because containers are flexible, lightweight, interchangeable, portable, scalable, and stackable.</p>
