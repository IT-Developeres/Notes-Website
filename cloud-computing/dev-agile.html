                   Agile is a iterative and flexible. In this method the projects broken into pieces which are developed and tested
 in short cycles. In agile the benefit is that we make changes during the development process.
The choice between them depends on the project needs such as clarity of requirements and necessity for flexibilty
 and periodically.  <span
                        class="text-green-600 font-semibold">When the requirement are not clear or there is doubt that the requirements change or something else then agile
 method is best. Agile is gernerally better in modern software because it allows to change requirements anytime.
